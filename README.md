## Instructions for use

- Press "M" to generate a random maze
- First click sets Start Point (Orange); Second click sets the End Point (Blue)
- Further clicking will generate barriers (Black)
- To deselect i.e. to make it into an unoccupied cell (White) use ctrl+click or right click.
- After you are done selecting start and end points, you may press "spacebar" to start the visualization of the path finding algorithm.
- Press "R" to reset the whole grid i.e turn all cells white
- Press "C" if you just want to clear the path that was created in an earlier execution. (This doesn't affect the barriers, weights, and start/end points.)

### If the Dijkstra's Algorithm doesn't show up when run locally, try [here](https://pathfinding-visualization-beta.vercel.app/).
